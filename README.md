# Text_Analytics_Amazon_Reviews

Text Analytics with R: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling.

Context:

In this project, I worked with actual reviews from Amazon in the Magazine Subscriptions category.  The PDF file “Final_Project_share” contains the details that are needed to be done (Question 2). In this project, I explored the data using descriptive statistics and plots, performed data cleaning, and performed Sentiment Analysis and Topic modeling. This work is part of the exam questions in Customer Analytics Course in my Master’s program.
